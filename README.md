# Asteroids-like game

Asteroids-like game written in C using the [SDL3](https://www.libsdl.org/)
library, and nothing more. Meant as a learning project for SDL3 and graphics in
general.

## Compilation

Run `make` to build the game. Then run `./asteroids` to run the game.

## Configuration

The file `src/config.h` contains the configuration for the game. Recompilation
is necessary for the changes to take effect.

## Controls

- <kbd>↑</kbd>: Thrust
- <kbd>↓</kbd>: Slow down
- <kbd>←</kbd>/<kbd>→</kbd>: Turn
- <kbd>Space</kbd>: Fire
- <kbd>Q</kbd>: Quit

## Possible upgrades

- Add sound
- SDL3_image for better graphics
